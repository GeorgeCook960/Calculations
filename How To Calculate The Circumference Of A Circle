How To Calculate The Circumference Of A Circle



While you may think that you only need to know what the circumference of a circle is and how to calculate it when you are a student, the truth is that this has a lot of uses. After all, no matter if you are putting a fence around your hot tub or doing any craftwork, you may need to know how to calculate the circumference of a circle. In case you simply want to get your results, just use our circumference calculator [ http://calcurator.org/circumference-calculator/ ]. 
 
Before we show you how you can easily calculate the circumference of a circle, you need to know what a circumference is.  
Simply put, a circumference is the distance around the perimeter of a circle. So, when you need to calculate it, you will need to multiply the distance across the center (or the diameter) by Pi (3.1416). 
  
How To Calculate The Circumference Of A Circle 
There are mainly two different methods that allow you to calculate the circumference of a circle:
  
Method #1: Using the Diameter
 
In order to calculate the circumference of a circle using the diameter, you will need to first write down the formula:
 
C = πd 
Where, 
C = circumference of the circle
π = 3.1416
d = diameter
 
Let's say that you have a circle tub with a diameter of 10 feet. So, you are looking to build a fence that creates an 8-foot wide space around the tub. 
 
So, to discover the circumference of the fend that you want to create, you will need to first determine the diameter of the tub itself and the tub. This will be:
 
10 feet + 8 feet + 8 feet - this is the entire diameter of the tub and fence. 
 
So, the total diameter is 26 feet. Now, you only need to replace the values in the formula:
 
C = πd
C = π x 26
C = 81.64 feet

Method #2: Using the Radius
 
In order to calculate the circumference of a circle using the radius, you will need to first write down the formula but using the radius this time. 
 
In case you don't know, the radius is half as long as the diameter. So, this means that you can think about the diameter as 2r. So, we can also write the circumference of the circle formula as:
 
C = 2πr
 
Where,
 
C = circumference of the circle
π = 3.1416
r = radius
 
Let's now say that you want to add a decorative strip of paper to wrap around the edge of a pie that you just baked. Consider that the radius of the pie is 5 inches.  
So, in order to determine the size of the decorative strip, you just need to replace the values on the formula that was provided:
 
C = 2πr
C = 2 x 3.14 x 5
C = 31.4 inches
